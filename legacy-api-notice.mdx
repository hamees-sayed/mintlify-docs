# Legacy API Notice

We want to assure our users that while we have introduced our new Waves API, we are committed to maintaining support for our legacy API. This ensures that existing integrations continue to function without interruption.

## Key Points

1. **Continued Support**: Our legacy API will remain fully operational and supported.
2. **No Immediate Action Required**: If you're currently using our legacy API, your integrations will continue to work as expected.
3. **Gradual Transition**: We encourage users to transition to the new Waves API at their own pace to take advantage of new features and improvements.
4. **Documentation Availability**: The documentation for our legacy API will remain accessible and up-to-date.
