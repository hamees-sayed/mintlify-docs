## Key Points

2. **Immediate Action Required**: If you're currently using our legacy API, you need to update your integrations to use the new Waves API as soon as possible.
3. **Transition Necessary**: We strongly urge all users to transition to the new Waves API immediately to ensure uninterrupted service and access to new features and improvements.
4. **Updated Documentation**: All documentation now refers to the new Waves API. Legacy API documentation is no longer available.
