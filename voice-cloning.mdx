## üéôÔ∏è How to Record Reference Audio

1. **Environment**  
   - Record in a quiet room with minimal background noise.  
   - Use a good quality microphone. Avoid phone recordings if possible.  

2. **Speaking Style**  
   - Speak naturally and avoid excessive emotion unless a specific tone is required.  
   - Maintain a consistent pace and tone throughout the recording.  

3. **Length of Audio**  
   - Provide at least 5 seconds to 15 seconds of clean audio.

## ‚úÖ What to Do  
- Use a microphone with a pop filter to reduce plosive sounds (e.g., "p" and "b" sounds).  
- Maintain a distance of 6-12 inches from the microphone for clarity.  
- Record in a single session to ensure consistency.  

## ‚ùå What Not to Do  
- Don‚Äôt record in noisy environments like cafes or parks.  
- Avoid using audio with overlapping voices or loud background sounds.  
- Don‚Äôt read with exaggerated emotion unless it‚Äôs intentional for emotional cloning.

## üîß Solving Common Problems

### Problem: My cloned voice sounds inconsistent.  
**Solution:** Ensure that your reference audio is clean and recorded in a single, uninterrupted session.

### Problem: My cloned voice sounds robotic or unnatural.  
**Solution:** Speak naturally and avoid reading mechanically. Providing expressive, clear audio helps the model learn your unique vocal characteristics.

# Emotional Reference Audio

Our platform supports emotional reference audio, meaning the emotions or tone in the reference audio will influence the output. This is ideal for creating expressive clones that match your intended tone.

## üé≠ How It Works  
- The tone of the reference audio (e.g., angry, happy, sad) directly impacts the generated voice output.  
- If you provide a **fast-paced** reference, the output will also be fast-paced. Similarly, if the input is **angry**, the output will sound angry.
