The **Waves API - Lightning Large** model is an advanced version of our text-to-speech engine, optimized for high-quality synthesis of natural-sounding speech. This API allows you to upload audio files and generate custom speech outputs, with enhanced capabilities for professional-grade applications.

To get started with the Waves API, you need an API key/Bearer token. You can obtain this by logging into the [Waves](https://waves.smallest.ai) platform and selecting `API key` from the left panel.

## API Endpoint

### **Create Speech from Audio**

The following endpoint allows you to generate speech from a given audio file using the Lightning Large model:

```
POST https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-large/create
```

### **Request Parameters**

- **Authorization**: You need to include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
  
- **File**: Upload your audio file using the `file` parameter. The file should be in WAV format.
  
- **displayName**: Provide a custom name for the generated audio output, such as a label or identifier for the request.

### **Example cURL Request**

Here is an example of how to use this API endpoint:

```bash
curl --location 'https://dev-waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-large/create' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
--form 'file=@"/path/to/your/file.wav"' \
--form 'displayName="custom_audio_output"'
```
