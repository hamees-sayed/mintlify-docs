# Reference Audio Examples for Voice Cloning

The quality and characteristics of your reference audio are essential for successful voice cloning. Below, you'll find two sections:
1. **Good vs. Bad Reference Audio**: How to ensure your audio is technically sound for cloning.
2. **Emotional and Stylistic Examples**: Demonstrating how the cloned voice mirrors the tone, emotion, and pace of the input.

## Section 1: Good vs. Bad Reference Audio

### **Example 1: Clarity**

**Good Reference Audio**
- ✅ Clear speech with no background noise.
<audio controls>
    <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/audio/gogol.wav" type="audio/wav" />
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

**Bad Reference Audio**
- ❌ Background noise and muffled voice make it unsuitable for cloning.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### **Example 2: Consistency**

**Good Reference Audio**
- ✅ Consistent tone and volume throughout the sample.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/wav" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

**Bad Reference Audio**
- ❌ Inconsistent volume or pitch distorts the cloning process.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### Key Takeaways for Good Reference Audio

- **Clear articulation**: No slurring or mumbling.
- **No background noise**: Avoid environmental or electronic interference.
- **Consistent tone**: Smooth and steady tone without sudden shifts.
- **Duration**: At least 30 seconds of audio for better results.

## Section 2: Emotional and Stylistic Reference Audio

Voice cloning can capture not just your voice but also the tone, emotion, and pacing of your input audio. Below are examples showing how different emotional or stylistic inputs affect the output.

### **Example 1: Emotional Tone**

**Neutral Tone Example**
- ✅ A calm and neutral tone results in a balanced output.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
**Angry Tone Example**
- ✅ An angry tone in the reference results in an angry voice clone.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
**Excited Tone Example**
- ✅ An excited tone creates an energetic output.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### **Example 2: Pacing**

**Normal Pacing Example**
- ✅ Steady pacing results in a natural output.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
**Fast Pacing Example**
- ✅ A fast-paced reference leads to a fast-paced output.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
**Slow Pacing Example**
- ✅ Slow and deliberate input creates a slower voice clone.
<audio controls>
  <source src="/workspaces/mintlify-docs/gogol.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### Key Takeaways for Emotional and Stylistic Audio

1. **Emotion Matters**:
   The cloned voice will capture the emotion in your reference audio. For example:
   - **Happy Input** → **Happy Output**
   - **Sad Input** → **Sad Output**

2. **Pace and Style**:
   The pacing and speaking style of the input audio directly affect the cloned voice. Use steady and consistent pacing for predictable results.

3. **Experiment with Style**:
   You can create a variety of voices by adjusting the tone, emotion, and pace of your reference audio.

## FAQ

### Will the cloned voice match the emotion and style of my input?
Yes! The cloning process is designed to reflect the tone, emotion, and pacing of your reference audio.

### Can I mix emotional audio with technically poor audio?
While the cloning process will capture emotion, poor audio quality (e.g., noise, distortion) can lead to inaccurate or low-quality clones. Always aim for clean recordings.

### How much reference audio do I need?
We recommend at least **5 seconds to 15 seconds** of clear audio for the best results.
