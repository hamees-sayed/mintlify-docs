## 🎙️ How to Record Reference Audio

### 1. **Choose the Right Environment**  
   - Record in a quiet room with minimal background noise.  
   - Use a high-quality microphone. While dedicated mics are ideal, MacBook and mobile microphones can also work well.  
   - Ensure your recording device is positioned at an appropriate distance—not too far or too close—to capture clear, natural sound without distortion.  
   - Avoid environments that introduce echo or distortion (e.g., large empty rooms or outdoor spaces).  
   - After recording, listen to your audio to confirm it is clear and free from interruptions, background noise, or distortion.  

### 2. **Optimal Audio Length**  
   - Provide **at least 45 minutes** of audio; **2+ hours** is ideal for the best results.  
   - The total runtime matters more than the number of individual samples.  
   - If uploading multiple hours of audio, it's best to split it into **~30-minute segments** for easier uploading.

### 3. **Use a Pop Filter**  
   - A pop filter reduces plosive sounds (e.g., "p" and "b" bursts), ensuring the AI captures a smooth and natural voice without harsh artifacts.

### 4. **Ensure Single-Speaker Audio**  
   - The reference audio should contain only the voice you intend to clone—avoid background voices or overlapping speech.
